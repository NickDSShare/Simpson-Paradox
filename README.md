# Simsom-Paradox
It is something that data analyst should be aware of

The following table shows two university entry rates between male and female. Someone concluded that there is a gender discrimination as the 
entry rate of female (40%) is lower than male (53%)

Is it the truth?


**Simpson's Paradox is a statistical phenomenon where an association between two variables in a population emerges, disappears or reverses when the population is divided into subpopulations.**


When we further look into the subgroups (i.e. subjects),interestingly, we can find that female always has higher entry rate than male in all subjects.

From the above, we can see that Nurse and Teacher are hard subjects compared to other subjects based on entry rate no matter which gender. Unfortunately, most of the females picked these subjects and so we expect there would be a lot of females failed to enter. As a result, it lowers down the overal entry rate of female.

Therefore, data analysts should not just look at the overall total rate / figures to judge a conclusion easily. They should also focus on the subgroup in order to explain a full picture.
